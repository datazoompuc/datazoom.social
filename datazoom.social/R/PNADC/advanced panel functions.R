# We will create the advanced panel for Panel 6 first, as an example, and then generalize it with functions and lists in order to apply the advanced panel to all panels.

# Firstly, we'll filter the observations that have already been identified using our basic panel

#We'll do so by using our code for friction calculations in our basic panel,
#this chunk of code gets an already-identified panel (all 5 quarters of it) and creates a column that indicates to us which interview the observation was identified by us

#in this example, data= the 6h panel, to replicate our example, just run the code below

# First, we'll have to line up the different changes available for each person
# For every change, we'll firstly investigate the number of matches per person, if they only have 1 match, we'll consider it done, and mark this person as matched, we'll have a column also illutrating at what "level" of strictness (from the defined below) this observation was matched.
